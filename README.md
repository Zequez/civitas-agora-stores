# Civitas Agora Stores

    An e-commerce platform for communities

## See it working

Currently running on [mercado.mardel.org](https://mercado.mardel.org),
for my local vegan community. You shall find all vegan stores and products in the
community.

## Assumptions

- Buying local we help our communities thrive.
- Buying local we reduce the stress we cause to our beloved Earth.
- Being aware of the origin of what you buy is important.
- Local commerce brings communities together.
- Closer communities are happier and more sustainable communities.
- The current system is collapsing, and the world is shifting into a new era.
- A vegan is a person that identifies with love

## Other communities

Currently the app is hardcoded in Spanish and working with a single community.
Easier methods of setting up new communities will be added.

## Goal

The goal isn't just to be an e-commerce platform, the goal is to be an ultimate guide, for
local commerce in a city. A place where people can go and see with clarity all the
options that there are, even if these options have varying and alternative
mechanism of commerce.

Things like group-purchasing, direct connection to farms, product origin mapping,
cooperative distribution nodes, cooperative delivery networks,
volunteer-based mapping, donation prompts from local organizations,
are all in the ultimate scope of the project.

As part of the community, we want to build a tool that works for the whole community.

## Why not blockchain?

I want to integrate it with Decentralized Autonomous Communities using the EOS platform,
but I haven't aquired the technical skills yet, so that's on the bucket list. In the
future I would want the entire thing to work serverless on blockchain, but that's
gonna take some time.

## Civitas Agora

The project is part of the Civitas Agora initiative, a project to create
local-focused apps for the next generation of cities and communities.
